# Documentation

Autogenerated Doxygen documentation. 

## Intallation
Go to http://www.doxygen.nl/download.html for instructions on how to install doxygen.

## Usage
1. Create Doxygen configuaration file:
    ```
    doxygen -g <config-file>
    ```
   This step is unnecessary for this project as the config file is included. The filename is doxygen_config.
2. Edit config file to make it generate project documentation. This step is also unnecessary for this project, 
since the file is already edited.
3. Generate Documentation:
    ```
    doxygen <config-file>
    ```
    For this project both html and latex documentation will be generated. Open the index.html file in a browser 
    to view documentation as html. To generate documentation as a pdf go to latex directory and run make:
    ```
    cd docs/latex
   make
    ```
   You will need pfdlatex in order to make the pdf.
