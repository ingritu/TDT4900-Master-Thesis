This is all based on Flickr8k.
top says that 4GB of memory is allocated during training,
this grows to 6GB during validation + 1.3GB java for SPICE stuff.
SPICE stuff is then cached, meaning it is permanently in memory.
This might mean that SPICE stuff will be downloaded every time we train a
model in idun and will stay in memory until training is done. It will also be
downloaded when we run predic_model because this is a different session.
