are reduced and not the number of captions per image.

# load cleaned training dataset

# remove images with less than 5 captions per image

# remove extra captions if there are images with more than 5 cations per image

# reduce the number of images until the total number of captions are roughly
# equal to the number of total captions of the reduced captions subsets.
